# Attrack ERP for College(Student-Side App)

Created an app as part of my training which facilitates students to check their attendance, notices, etc. I used Firebase for the database and the app follows Google Material design guidelines to ensure a good app experience. 

## Login flow
- Every Student will be given a specific id and password to login.
- Sample Id & Password for login- “00000” & “qwertyui”
